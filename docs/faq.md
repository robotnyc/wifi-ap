# FAQ

This section covers some of the most commonly encountered problems and attempts
to resolve them.

## Can I run an AP in parallel to being connected to another WiFi network?

Yes this is possible. If the device only has a single WiFi network device there
are limitations though (e.g. both need to operate on the same channel). See
[Simultaneous STA / AP Mode](simultaneous-sta-ap-mode.md) for more details.

## Why isn't the AP automatically enabled after I've installed the snap?

Normally it should automatically come up if this isn't disabled through the
device configuration inside the gadget snap. See
[Snap Configuration](reference/snap-configuration.md#automatic-setup.disable)
for more details.
