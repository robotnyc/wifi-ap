  [ Alfonso Sanchez-Beato <alfonso.sanchez-beato@canonical.com> ]
  * Add country code configuration options so the beacon frames
    contain that IE.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/wifi-ap/+merge/326219
  * Refactor handling of country code, so now the only option
    exposed in the configure hook is wifi.country_code. Added
    also a new spread test.
