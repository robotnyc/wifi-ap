summary: Verify AP configuration is written atomically

details: |
    Previous versions of the wifi-ap snap didn't write out the state
    of the AP configuration file atomically so that we ended in a
    state without any of the previously set configuration items when
    an error occured.

    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy-hwe-snaps/+bug/1694486 for
    more details.

execute: |
    wifi-ap.config set wifi.ssid=Foo
    test "$(wifi-ap.config get wifi.ssid)" = Foo
    ! wifi-ap.config set ssid=Bar
    # Before LP #1694486 got fixed the value for the wifi.ssid item has
    # been reset to the default value now, which is 'Ubuntu', because
    # we supplied an invalid configuration key 'ssid' above.
    test "$(wifi-ap.config get wifi.ssid)" = Foo
